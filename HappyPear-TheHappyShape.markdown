### Health Benefits of a Plant-Based Diet
* Reduced fat intake
  * mainly found in animal products and refined plants only such as coconut and palm oil
* Reduced dietary cholesterol
  * excretion of cholesteron > through beta-glucans (oats, beans)
* Reduced intake of foods containing antibiotics and artificial hormones
  * up to 80% of the antibiotics used in the US are used in animal agriculture, to prevent infections from spreading among animals kept in unhygenic and overcrowded conditions
  * artificial hormones are also used in farming to speed up growth of an animal to produce a greater yield
* Increased intake of fibre
  * the more fibre in your diet, the better equipped the body is to eliminate waste, excrete cholesterol, maintain an optimal weigth and improve immune functions
  * fibre is super important for your microbiome, wehre 70% of your immune system is based and 95% of your serotonin (happy hormone) is produced
  * microbiome - consists of trillions of microorganisms and bacteria that make up your gut
* Increased antioxidant intake
  * antioxidants are essential for neutralising free-radicals
  * richly-coloured foods are the primary source of antioxidants
