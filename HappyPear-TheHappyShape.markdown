by Happy Pear

### **Genral Information**

* **MEAT**
  * no fibre
  * high in saturated fats
  * contains cholesterol
  * contains very little antioxidants (from the plants the animal eats)
  * very low in vitamins
  
* **DAIRY PRODUCTS**
  * high in saturated fats
  * contain cholesterol
  * often high in hormones
  * have no fiber
  
* **EGGS**
  * the **MOST** concentrated source of cholesterol
  * 1 eg -> 200mg cholesterol in the yolk (daily max â‰ˆ 300mg)
 
* **OIL**
  * the **MOST** caloric dense substance on the planet (8K cal/l <=> 120cal/tbsp)
  * no fibre; little to no nutrition
  * the ultimate refined food
    * we extract it from the whole food, discarding the fibre and nearly all the vitamins and minerals leaving us with nothing but **FAT**

* **FATS**
  * saturated
  * unsaturated
    * monounsaturated
    * polyunsaturated (the body can't make them)
      * Omega 3 & Omega 6 (chia, flaxseeds, walnuts) 
      
* **PROTEIN**
  * made up of building blocks called amino-acids
  * 0.8g of protein/Kg of body weight
  
* **IRON**
  * essential to transport oxygen around our body and to our muscles (via red blood cells)
  * two types of iron:
    1. haem iron (found in animal product)
    1. non-haem iron (found in plants)
    
  * **Haem Iron**:
    * readily absorbed (even if not required)
    * once absorbed, our bodies have no efficient way of excreting it
      * as iron is pro-oxidant, too much can cause DNA damage and has been linked to some diseases including Alzheimer's & Parkinson's, cardiovascular diseases, arthritis and some forms of cancer
      
  * to boost iron, you can add sources of vit. C to your meals to support iron absorbtion (peppers, broccoli, grapefruit, oranges)
  * avoid tea and coffee at meal times as the tannins in these drinks can inhibit iron absorbtion and increase the intake of beans and pulses
  
  
### **Whole Food Plant-Based Diet**
- centres on whole, unrefined and unprocessed foods
- fruits, vegetables, wholegrains, legumes, nuts and seeds
- excludes most refined and processed foods such as flours, sugars and oils

### Health Benefits of a Plant-Based Diet
* Reduced fat intake
  * mainly found in animal products and refined plants only such as coconut and palm oil
* Reduced dietary cholesterol
  * excretion of cholesteron > through beta-glucans (oats, beans)
* Reduced intake of foods containing antibiotics and artificial hormones
  * up to 80% of the antibiotics used in the US are used in animal agriculture, to prevent infections from spreading among animals kept in unhygenic and overcrowded conditions
  * artificial hormones are also used in farming to speed up growth of an animal to produce a greater yield
* Increased intake of fibre
  * the more fibre in your diet, the better equipped the body is to eliminate waste, excrete cholesterol, maintain an optimal weigth and improve immune functions
  * fibre is super important for your microbiome, wehre 70% of your immune system is based and 95% of your serotonin (happy hormone) is produced
  * microbiome - consists of trillions of microorganisms and bacteria that make up your gut
* Increased antioxidant intake
  * antioxidants are essential for neutralising free-radicals
  * richly-coloured foods are the primary source of antioxidants
