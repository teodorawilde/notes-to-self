The Paschima Sutra (SBL - Superficial Back Line)
- connects the neck with the muscles of the entire spine through the back body - as well as sacrum, legs and feet
- a continuity of fascial fabric from the bottom of the foot to the top of the head -- through the scalp to the space between the eyebrows

The fascia of the paschima sutra is generally "stretched" over the primary curves.

Primary Curves:
- created by the shape of the bones (set up from when the child is in the mother's womb)
- where it convers the primary curves, it stretches over and stabilize these curves
- where the PS gets overstretched, the primary curve can become exagerrated - such as an excessively rounded upper back
- where the PS get excessively contracted or hypertonic, it can reduce or flatten the primary curve - such as flattened or even reverse thoracic curve

Secondary Curves:
- created and maintained by muscular action
- where it covers the secondary curves, it contracts to create and maintain these curves
- where the PS gets overstretched or weakened, these curves are lost, and often the primary curves become exaggerated as well -such as in the stooped or rounded postures of the eldery
- where the PS gets excessively contracted or hypertonic, it increases or exaggerates these curves
