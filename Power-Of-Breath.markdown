## Breathing Techniques

### Dirga Swasam (aka The 3-Part Deep Breathing)

The idea behind this technique is to be able utilise the lungs completely. The three parts consisting of:
  - drawing the diaphragm down into to the belly
  - breathing into the chest
  - breathing into the upper chest
  
Most of us are chest breathers, we don't do it using our full functions resulting into more prana/energy exchange.

**Technique:**
- bring awareness by having a hand on the belly and the other one on the chest; (fill on inhale)
- inhale into the belly on a count to 4
- inhale into the mid-chest on a count to 2
- inhale into the upper-chest on a count to 2
- exhale out of the upper chest on a ocunt to 2
- exhale out of the mid-chest on a count to 4
- exhale out of the belly on a count to 2

It is not as important whether you stick to the count yet whether you expand completely; this way we get the deepest breath.
The breathing is done through the nose because it is a great organ to actually filter out the air. It takes out big particles, as well the mucus membrane takes out small particles while warming and humidifying the oxigen that is going into our lungs. Hence we get a better oxygen exchange in our lungs.

### Ujjayi (aka Victorious/Ocean Breath)

The breath that is most commonly used in the Asana practices.
Ashtanga added the pranayama practices into the asana practice and that where Ujjayi came in.

Traditionally, Ujjayi is a very soft breath.
pranayama -> prana = vitality/life force; awayama = to extend;
So what we are trying to do is to extend the breath. A lot of the time it is done in a very harsh/hard manner which can be very damaging to the vocal chords and the throat. That also uses a lot more energy than it is actually needed. We are over-breathing.
The whole idea of pranayama is not to over-breath, yet only hard enough to be able to blow out a candle.

Ujjayi gives us the ability to regulate how much oxygen we are pulling into the body and how much we are expanding out of the body. This is done by constricting the back of the throat. The vocal chords get pulled together heance creating an ocean-like sound. Simillary with trying to fog up a mirror, only done with the mouth closed.

**Technique:**
- should be done only lound enough so we could hear it; this way we keep the breath nice and soft, not breathing more than we need to
- constriction applies on both inhale and exhale; while keeping the mouth closed

The whole point is to use the breath to extend the inhale so we could breathe slower, loger, regulating how much is coming in, same being applied for the exhale. Its purpose is to also cultivate awarness and minduflness. The more that we pay attention to the softness of the breath the more mindfulness we bring.
